# Spider-bot
A simple quadrupedal spider-like robot.
This project is a part of the complete project done by me and my teammates, including a drone for a 2 way surveillance system utilizing the concept of swarm robotics.
This project was selected to be in the final of the India International Science Festival 2021 held at GOA by the Government of India.

This code is only a hardcoded model for the walking gait of the spiderbot.
